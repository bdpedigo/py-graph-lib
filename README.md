# py-graph-lib
Collection of python graph libraries and tools that could be useful

## Libraries

### NetworkX
- [Github](https://github.com/networkx/networkx)
- Ubiquitous
- All Python (slow) 
- Huge variety of algorithms

### Graspy
- [Github](https://github.com/neurodata/graspy)
- ASE/LSE/OMNI
- Graph testing
- Graph matching

### Topologic
- [Github](https://github.com/microsoft/topologic)
- ASE/LSE/OMNI
- community detection? (Leiden)

### iGraph Python
- [Github](https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph)
- interface to iGraph library
- not a fan of the API or docs 
- has a bunch of community detection methods 
- should be faster than NetworkX and has a lot of low level implementation stuff

### Graph-tool
- [Gitlab](https://git.skewed.de/count0/graph-tool)

### CDLib
- [Github](https://github.com/GiulioRossetti/cdlib/blob/master/docs/index.rst)
 
### GCNN survey paper
- [Github](https://github.com/google/gcnn-survey-paper)
- Not exactly a package in the same sense 
- useful framework in the paper itself, haven't looked at the code much

### Scipy.sparse.graph
- [Github]()
- [Docs](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.csgraph.html)
- A lot of low level stuff for adjacency matrices
- Ubiquitous
- Limited scope of algorithms
